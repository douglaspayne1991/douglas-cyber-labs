# What is Networking?
- **Date:** 2025-11-10
- **Level:** Pre-Security / Network Fundamentals

## Quick summary
Intro to basic networking concepts: hosts, IP addresses, routers, switches, and how devices talk on a network.

## Commands / tools to try
- `ip a` or `ifconfig` — view local IP configuration
- `ping <target>` — test reachability
- `traceroute <target>` — see route packets take
- `arp -a` — view ARP table (local network mapping)

## What I learned
Write 2–4 lines here after finishing the room (e.g., how IP addressing works, difference between router/switch, or how traceroute works).

## Next practice
Complete Intro to LAN and practice `ping`, `traceroute`, and `arp` on a local VM or AttackBox.

## Artifacts
Place screenshots in `tryhackme/Networking/artifacts/` and embed them like:
